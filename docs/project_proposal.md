## Introduction

Phishing emails remain one of the most persistent threats to students, staff, and institutions. At Bowie State University, there is currently no centralized platform for reporting suspicious emails. Under current guidelines, users are instructed to not open any suspicious emails and report phishing incidents to the university information systems team however, users may not always be successful in this process and there is no formalized or mandatory email security awareness training. This creates challenges for both end users and security staff, as threats often go unreported or untracked.

The GUARDBULLDOG Phishing Awareness and Reporting System will address this problem by offering a platform where students and staff can report phishing attempts quickly, while also accessing educational content on recognizing phishing threats. In addition to empowering users, the system will track reported incidents and generate data that can support ongoing improvements to the university’s cybersecurity posture.

## Project Objectives

The GUARDBULLDOG Phishing Awareness and Reporting System is designed to achieve several key objectives, each of which addresses a critical need in BSU’s current approach to phishing prevention and response:

1.  **Create a Centralized Phishing Reporting Platform**
    *   Objective: Develop a web-based and mobile application that will allow BSU students, faculty, and staff to report phishing emails easily and efficiently.
    *   Impact: This system will replace the informal, ad-hoc process with a centralized, streamlined system, ensuring all phishing incidents are documented and tracked in one location.
2.  **Improve Phishing Awareness Across the BSU Community**
    *   Objective: Provide educational content directly within the platform, helping users learn how to recognize phishing attempts and avoid falling victim to these attacks.
    *   Impact: Users will have access to continuous training and best practices, leading to a more informed and cyber-aware community that can better protect itself from phishing threats.
3.  **Simplify the Reporting Process for Users**
    *   Objective: Ensure that submitting a phishing report is as simple as forwarding an email or uploading an attachment. The platform will be designed to be intuitive, minimizing the steps required to report a phishing attempt.
    *   Impact: This user-friendly design will increase engagement, ensuring that more incidents are reported, tracked, and responded to promptly.
4.  **Enable Effective Incident Tracking and IT Support**
    *   Objective: Integrate incident tracking features that allow users to see the status of their reports (e.g., “pending,” “under investigation,” “resolved”) and provide a direct communication channel to the IT Service Help Desk for further assistance if needed.
    *   Impact: This will provide both users and IT staff with clear visibility into the status of phishing reports, expediting responses and facilitating more effective mitigation strategies.
5.  **Collect and Analyze Data on Phishing Incidents**
    *   Objective: The platform will gather data on phishing incidents to generate reports and analytics that identify trends, common attack sources, and recurring threats.
    *   Impact: The data will allow BSU’s IT team to improve response strategies and adapt their defenses against emerging phishing tactics, contributing to an overall stronger cybersecurity posture at BSU.

## Project Team and Roles

*   **System Project Manager - Ashleigh Mosley**: Guides the project, develops schedules, assigns tasks, monitors progress, and ensures alignment with project goals.
*   **System Designer/Architect/Engineer - Mouhamadou Thiam**: Ensures the platform is well-structured, scalable, and compliant. Gathers requirements, creates diagrams, and recommends technologies.
*   **System Implementator - Enrique Wallace**: Translates the architectural design into a fully operational platform, configuring interfaces, databases, and servers.
*   **System Analyst and Tester - Amanda Burroughs**: Ensures the platform meets user needs, outlines workflows, and conducts functional and usability testing.
*   **System Developer - Victory Ubogu**: Builds the backend and frontend components, manages database design, and prioritizes security.

## System Features

1.  **Phishing Report Submission**: Users can submit phishing emails through a web or mobile interface. Each submission receives a tracking number.
2.  **Educational Resources**: A library of articles, videos, and guides on recognizing phishing threats.
3.  **Incident Tracking and Status Updates**: Users can track the status of their reports (e.g., "Under Investigation," "Resolved").
4.  **Support and Escalation**: Users can escalate serious incidents to the IT Service Help Desk.
5.  **Data Analytics and Reporting**: Administrators can access customizable dashboards with data on phishing incidents.

## User Groups & Associated System Features

1.  **Students**: Submit reports, access educational content, track report status.
2.  **Faculty**: Report emails, access advanced resources, escalate critical incidents.
3.  **Administrators**: Monitor reports, manage user access, and ensure system health.
4.  **University IT Service Help Desk Team**: Investigate reports, provide user assistance, and escalate major incidents.
5.  **University Information Systems Team**: Analyze data, develop proactive measures, and improve the platform.

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

*   **User Authentication**: Secure login using BSU credentials; guest access for non-BSU affiliates.
*   **Phishing Report Submission**: Submit by forwarding or uploading email content; system generates tracking numbers.
*   **Incident Tracking**: Real-time status tracking with notifications.
*   **Support and Escalation**: Escalate critical incidents to the IT Service Help Desk.
*   **Educational Content Delivery**: Interactive guides and regularly updated content.
*   **Data Analytics and Reporting**: Customizable reports on incident frequency, sources, and types.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **Scalability**: Handle a growing number of users and reports.
*   **Performance**: Optimal performance under load with no delays.
*   **Security**: Data encryption and adherence to BSU cybersecurity policies.
*   **Usability**: Intuitive interface for easy navigation.
*   **Reliability**: High availability with minimal downtime; backup and recovery processes.

## Research Methodology

1.  **How are phishing emails currently handled at BSU?**: Engage with the BSU IT Department to assess the current process.
2.  **What similar solutions exist outside of academia?**: Conduct a benchmarking study of other organizations.

## Expected Outcomes

*   Comprehensive understanding of BSU's current phishing management.
*   Insights into effective solutions from other organizations.
*   Clear definition of the system’s scope.

## Implementation Timeline

1.  **Research and Analysis** (Due 9/26)
2.  **Proposal Revision** (Due 9/28)
3.  **Requirement Specification Iteration #1** (Due 10/5)
4.  **System Design and Development** (Due 11/5)
5.  **Testing and Deployment** (Due 12/1)
6.  **Post-Deployment Support** (Ongoing)

## Conclusion

The GUARDBULLDOG system will be a critical tool for BSU in combating phishing threats. By formalizing the reporting process, providing educational resources, and enabling effective incident tracking, the system will help protect sensitive data and foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness.
